        <h3>About Patiala</h3>
        <p>
          Patiala is a city in south-eastern Punjab, north-western India. It is
          the state's fourth-largest city and the administrative capital of the
          Patiala district. Patiala is the erstwhile princely state of Punjab,
          which is situated in the Malwa region. The city covers a total area of
          365 km. It is a judicious synthesis of a brilliant spectrum of Rajput,
          Mughal, and Punjabi cultures and a fine blend of modernity and
          tradition. It connects to Delhi, Ambala, and Chandigarh well by rail
          and road. It is around 280 Km from IGI Airport Delhi and 60 Km from
          Chandigarh Airport. Shimla, Dharamshala, Manali, and Amritsar are
          nearby cities of attraction.
